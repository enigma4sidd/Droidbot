# Droidbot

Senior Year Project - Android Programming, JAVA, Embedded C, Wireless - Bluetooth, Machine Learning

The project uses an Android device to remotely control a robot. This is achieved by developing an android application that recognizes user's speech, and transmits the commands wirelessly over to a microcontroller based robot. The robot is equipped with a wireless camera to provide live feed of its surroundings. In the developed prototype we command a Microcontroller based robot to move forward, backward, turn left or right while simultaneously providing a live visual feedback to the controller. Its application is in surveillance, places where humans find difficult to reach. E.g. in a small pipeline, in fire-situations, and in highly toxic areas.
